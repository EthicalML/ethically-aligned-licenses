# Ethically Aligned Software Licenses

This repository contains a summary of the current idea of developing a set of "Ethically Aligned Licenses". This would consist of a set of the most common open source software licenses modified to require alignment to an "ethical framework". The current Ethical Framework being considered is the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](http://ethics.acm.org).

## Licenses in this repository

The current licenses provided include:

* [Ethically Aligned Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/EthicalML/ethically-aligned-licenses/blob/master/LICENSE_EA_MIT)
* [Ethically Aligned MIT License](https://github.com/EthicalML/ethically-aligned-licenses/blob/master/LICENSE_EA_MIT)


## Roadmap

We aim to continuously improve this repository, extending the number of licenses we provide. Our current roadmap aims to include the following licenses:

* Ethically Aligned Mozilla Public License 2.0
* Ethically Aligned GNU License
* Ethically Aligned LGPL License
